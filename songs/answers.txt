1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    I would describe a listener's aura by looking into what were the top genres and songs in 2018.

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    This measurement would not be that effective because:
        a. the data involved is only from 2018. Having more data to analyse would undoubtedly provide a better pattern in a listener's preference in music.
        b. the data might not be influenced only by one person and this can lead to imprecise result. (Collaborative Listening)
        c. the data does not present any details about the listener which is key in finding out musical taste.

    As far as my concerned, brodening the database with datasets from several years, analysing streaming history and differentiating the listener's personal choices
    from the ones influenced by collaborating with others would help us improve our aura analysis.
